# nodeJs/nodeJsApiPractice
File system (fs) module - played with both sysc and async file open, read, write functions.

Net module (net) - played with the client/server connectivity example, worked well.

OS module (os) - interesting to see how the standard os level type cmds are implimented in node:-)
